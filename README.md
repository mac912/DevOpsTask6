Perform third task with the help of Jenkins coding file ( called as jenkinsfile approach ) and perform the with following phases:

1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed  using dockerfile  Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7

2.  When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.

3.  Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

4.  Job2 ( Seed Job ) : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

5. Further on jobs should be pipeline using written code  using Groovy language by the developer

6. Job1 :  
    1. By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically s
    tart the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )


    2.  Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod
    
    3. Make the data to remain persistent using PVC ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )

7.  Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.

8.  Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the dev
